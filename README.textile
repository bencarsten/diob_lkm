h1. Dynamic I/O buffering (a Linux kernel module)

h2. Introduction

The idea of this module is to provide automatic buffering for I/O on Linux at the
level of system calls.

h2. Strategy

Every process has a file descriptor table in which file descriptors are mapped to
entries in the system-wide open file table. These pointers are converted into a 
CRC-16 checksum, resulting in a maximum of 2^16 files being watched for I/O behaviour.

h2. Todo

- it is unclear what happens when the module is unloaded and hooked syscalls, 
  especially read, are pending
